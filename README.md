#  Host based ad blocker using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

This project shows the setup of my host based ad blocker using Raspberry Pi 2 Zero W

The Raspberry Pi blocks ads and malicious content at the SOHO network level using Pi hole

Reconfigured the DNS server to the Pi hole, allowing automatic DNS resolution, blocklisting ads and malicious domains, and allowing configuration on each device connected to the wifi.
