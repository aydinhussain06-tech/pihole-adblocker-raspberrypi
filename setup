# Setup Steps

# Tools used: 
- Micro SD Card
- Micro Adapter
- Rapsberry Pi Zero 2 W
- SD Card Reader
- Micro usb connecter

# Initial Raspberry Pi Configuration
- Created username and password
- Enabled SSH
- Installed packages
- Connected micro SD card to raspberry pi

# Installing pi hole and final setups
- Logged into raspberry pi through SSH
- Installed pi hole on it
- Logged into router and reserved the IP of the raspberry pi

# Troubleshooting
- When manually changing my router's DNS server to the raspberry pi's static ip address it disconnects from having internet connection
- Bell (my IPS) restricts custom DNS at the router level

# Fix
- Manually configure the DNS server on each device by setting it to the IP of the raspberry PI
- Statically assigned IP for my TV since I set the IP settings to static
- Added extra blocklists for youtube ads
